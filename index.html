	<p>The purpose of this website is to disseminate learnings from an ongoing research project designed to understand how organizations translate the action of their constituents into political influence. We have conducted six in-depth case studies across the United States (Arizona, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, and Virginia) and will use this website to share some of our preliminary findings with a broader audience. The reflections we share here  are preliminary and the data from which they are drawn are largely deidentified (unless organizations or interviewees explicitly gave us their permission to name them). What we present here is partial, but it is intended to continue ongoing conversations we are having with practitioners, colleagues, and funders who have expressed interest in the findings.</p>	
	<p> Our research examines the internal workings of vehicles of collective action to understand how they translate resources into power. Whether these vehicles take the form of formal bureaucratic organizations or more dispersed movement networks, all of them successfully operated as intermediary institutions between the mass public and governmental institutions.  They simultaneously reach inward to develop the capacities ordinary people need to act as agents of change in society, and outward to pressure decision makers to heed the concerns of these constituents. Despite the centrality of these types of associations and leaders to collective action, surprisingly little research unpacks the core logic that makes it possible for them to translate action into political influence. Our book, tentatively titled <i> The Organizational Foundations of People Power</i>, steps into that gap. We will use this site to make available some of our reflections since the rhythms of academic publishing are slower than those of the world out there.</p>
